# Mbed_Water_Curtain
Field Programmable Water Array using solenoids and mbed

In 2017, Cirque du Soleil incorporated a spinning water curtain into their show. The water curtain mechanism was able to form many different designs and shapes in the falling water by opening and closing an array of valves at preprogrammed intervals. Our group decided to create a miniature DIY version of the water curtain using a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M mbed microcontroller and an array of inexpensive solenoids. This became the final project for our undergraduate Electrical and Computer Engineering course: ECE 4180 Embedded Systems Design taught by Professor James O. Hamblen at Georgia Institute of Technology.
